## CIS 3500 Homework #1

### PART IV: Create a Landing Page (hugo-mock-landing-page)

Summary of PART IV Tasks + Additional Practice

1. Set up public hugo-mock-landing-page repository, cloned it to my computer, and added .gitignore file
2. Followed instructions in Chapter 1 to set up the base Hugo site, added the hugo-bootstrap-theme, and configured the repository to work with the theme
3. Practiced categorizing, staging and committing all of my changes in a clear, concise, and organized manner to maximize readability
4. Created USER_STORIED.md file with the user stories for my landing page's technology
5. Removed unecessary content from the existing framework
6. Customized the landing page with 6 features (including 3 illustrations), a logo, and a specific color scheme
7. Customized 3 featured posts explaining more about the subject of my landing page, including various illustrations 
8. Configured and published my site

In addition to creating and customizing the landing page framework, I wanted to expand more fully upon the site and to get more practice with Hugo; thus, I decided to customize three of the featured posts on the website. I think that this definitely added to the overall completeness and quality of my landing page, as well as helped me to gain some more practical experience in building a webpost with Hugo.
