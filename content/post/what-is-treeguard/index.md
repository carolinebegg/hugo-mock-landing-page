## What Is TreeGuard AI?

This semester, I am taking the class MGMT 2760 *(Entrepreneurship and Technological Innovation)*, which is Wharton Management class that is part of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation concentration and the Engineering Entrepreneurship minor. As part of the final project for this class, we had to choose a novel technology on which to build an entrepreneurial firm and describe the value that the firm would bring to what customers and users.

When I was in the ideation phase for this assignment and was brainstorming user stories, I felt building a landing page for this (fake) entrepreneurial firm felt very relevant, especially given the nature of the technology and the project. In another post, I have some more detailed information about the actual technology that inspired this firm and the value that the first creates for its users, so be sure to check those out as well!
